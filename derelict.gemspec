    Provides a Ruby API to control Vagrant where Vagrant is         \
    installed via the Installer package on Mac OS X.

    Vagrant was historically available as a gem, naturally          \
    providing a Ruby API to control Vagrant in other Ruby libraries \
    and applications. However, since version 1.1.0, Vagrant is      \
    distributed exclusively using an Installer package. To control  \
    Vagrant when it's installed this way, other Ruby libraries and  \
    applications typically need to invoke the Vagrant binary, which \
    requires forking a new process and parsing its output using     \
    string manipulation.
